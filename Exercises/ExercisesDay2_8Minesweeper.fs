    // Add the mine counts to a completed Minesweeper board.

    // Minesweeper is a popular game where the user has to find the mines using
    // numeric hints that indicate how many mines are directly adjacent
    // (horizontally, vertically, diagonally) to a square.

    // In this exercise you have to create some code that counts the number of
    // mines adjacent to a given empty square and replaces that square with the
    // count.

    // The board is a rectangle composed of blank space (' ') characters. A mine
    // is represented by an asterisk ('\*') character.

    // If a given space has no adjacent mines at all, leave that square blank.

    // ## Examples

    // For example you may receive a 5 x 4 board like this (empty spaces are
    // represented here with the '·' character for display on screen):

    // ```text
    // ·*·*·
    // ··*··
    // ··*··
    // ·····
    // ```

    // And your code will transform it into this:

    // ```text
    // 1*3*1
    // 13*31
    // ·2*2·
    // ·111·
    // ```
